04/06/2020 15:19;04/06/2020 15:30;607;Agree;Two reasons. One is because I liked having a universal place to store my code that I could access from anywhere. The other, which I slowly grew to care more about, was discoverability and community. Making my code open-source means that it's easier to find, and anyone can either use it as a reference and/or contribute to it if they feel so inclined.;Nowadays, because so many of the tools and so much of the software that I use are open source, it makes sense that I would do what I can to contribute to projects that I use most often.

It's easy to get into a situation where you give more time and energy to projects for free, and you never get support for doing so. In the long run, this tends to burn people out and leave projects orphaned. Finding a way to support your FOSS efforts is critical to the long term success of the ecosystem. I think that this support can take many forms, but at some level it needs to be financial. Significant FOSS contributors still need to be able to support themselves and their families.;Arbor_Chat_Project,Gio,SourceHut;5;15;Unpaid Contributor;Most of my contributions are unpaid;Code Development;Code Development,Bug Triaging,Community Building;No;Master's degree;Professional Developer;Man;United States of America;United States of America;North America;no;North America;25 to 34;Yes;twitter
