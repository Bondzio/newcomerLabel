Why is this research being done? 

The Open Source landscape has changed a lot during the last decade. Existing literature about motivation to contribute dates from the early 2000s and does not cover the potential changes that the involvement of companies and foundations brought. Our aim to understand what is currently motivating contributors in Open Source projects. By investigating this new scenario, we will help companies and communities to understand how to bring and retain newcomers, creating more sustainable communities.



Information about your participation

Since you are an Open Source contributor, we would like to kindly ask you a couple of questions about motivation, success, and demographics. This survey will take about 10 minutes and we will raffle one $100 gift-card per every 100 participants. You will be asked if you want to be included in the raffle upon completion of our survey. To be included in the raffle, you need to provide your e-mail address (which will be used only for the raffle). 



You are being asked to participate in a research study. Your participation in this research study is voluntary and you do not have to participate. Please consider the following information carefully. Feel free to ask questions before making your decision whether or not to participate. 

 

There are no expected risks to you as a result of participating in this study. Although you will not benefit directly from participating in this study, this will increase the knowledge about developers’ motivations, benefitting the open source communities.

 

Your name is not required and will not be used in any report. Research data will be encrypted, and password protected. Your responses will be assigned a code number. When the study is completed and the data have been analyzed, the list will be destroyed. Because of the nature of the data, it may be possible to deduce your identity; however, there will be no attempt to do so and your data will be reported in a way that will not identify you.

 

Information collected will not be used or shared for future research studies. The information that you provide in the study will be handled confidentially. However, there may be circumstances where this information must be released or shared as required by law. Northern Arizona University Institutional Review Board may review the research records for monitoring purposes.

 

You can request the removal of your data from this research at any time, even after providing the consent, by sending a request to the researchers’ email with the code provided below.

 

For questions, concerns, or complaints about the study, you may contact the principal investigator, Prof. Dr. Igor Steinmacher .

 

For questions about your rights as a participant in this study or to discuss other study-related concerns or complaints with someone who is not part of the research team, you may contact the Human Subjects Research Protection Program at 928-523-9551 or online at http://nau.edu/Research/Compliance/Human-Research/Welcome/.
